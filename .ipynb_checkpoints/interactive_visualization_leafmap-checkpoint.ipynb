    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrated various interactive visualization techniques using leafmap:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Zanzibar Examples**: Local maps, building footprints, flood risk zones\n",
    "2. **Basic Maps**: Creating maps with different styles, projections, and controls\n",
    "3. **Basemaps**: Adding tile layers, WMS services\n",
    "4. **3D Visualization**: Terrain, buildings, indoor maps\n",
    "5. **Vector Data**: Points, lines, polygons with styling and popups\n",
    "6. **Raster Data**: Local files, COG, STAC\n",
    "7. **PMTiles**: Cloud-native vector tiles\n",
    "8. **H3 Hexagons**: Spatial aggregation and visualization\n",
    "9. **Multimedia**: Video overlays, custom HTML\n",
    "10. **Legends & Colorbars**: Built-in and custom legends\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use **cloud-native formats** (COG, PMTiles) for better performance\n",
    "- Choose **appropriate color schemes** for your data type\n",
    "- **3D visualization** can reveal patterns not visible in 2D\n",
    "- **Interactive controls** improve user engagement\n",
